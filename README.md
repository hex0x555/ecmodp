# ecmodp
Calculates points on elliptic curve over finite field, graphs points, performs elliptic curve point addition, and generates cayley table

steps for now :
commands 

0) cd project #(to be in proper yaml directory)  
1) docker-compose down  
2) docker-compose build --no-cache  #(this rebuilds from scratch)
3) docker-compose up

do these commands from the directory level that has the docker compose file 



## Deployment notes from 9/8
- from console start instance
- open terminal ssh into it (from my computer with the pem file i do `ssh -i ~/Desktop/ecmodp11.pem ec2-user@18.216.219.102` )
- then i gotta see whats wrong
